My name is Tommaso Bradanini, second year PhD student in Physics. I work in the CUPID collaboration, a future large scale bolometric experiment for the search of netrinoless double beta decay of 100Mo. I focus mainly on the R&D of Li2MoO4 crystals, especially on their radiopurity and scintillating properties evaluation through bolometric measurements performed with CUPID Hall C cryostat at LNGS, as well as precursor material screening through various low background experimental techniques.
